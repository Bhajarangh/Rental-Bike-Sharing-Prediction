# 🚴‍♂️ Rental Bike Sharing Prediction

This project focuses on predicting the count of total rental bikes using various environmental and seasonal settings. Using a regression-based machine learning approach, it provides insights into how external conditions influence rental demand.


## 📌 Problem Statement

Bike-sharing systems have become increasingly popular, especially in metropolitan cities. Understanding demand based on time, weather, and seasonality is crucial for effective planning and service management. The objective of this project is to build a predictive model that estimates bike rental count using historical data.
